# Error analysis on PhoNER-COVID19 dataset

In this project, we reproduce the results of PhoBERT, X-LMR and Bi-LSTM reported in []. We also train and evaluate using multilingual BERT (cased version, as suggested in []). We further analyse the prediction results of the best models to gain deeper understanding on the classification performance among Vietnamese named-entities. 

Our error analysis schema follows the previous work []. The 5-error-types demonstrates the pros and cons of the models and allow us to make more informed decisions on later improvements.

The code and report for the error analysis on PhoNER-COVID19 dataset can the found in the supplementals.
